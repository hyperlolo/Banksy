This project was done over course of Spring 2020, it was hindered a bit by the emergence of COVID-19, however, it has given me
a good understanding of how to work remotely on a project. My part in this project involved with the planning and creation of the
database and its relational schema, along with the creation of the website. I was tasked with the creation of the websites back end
heavily as I created all of the pages visible on the website, along with the logic that made them work properly. I also contributed
to the design of the main pages such as the Ad-Hoc, relational tables, and the query table results page. The CRUD page was designed
and programmed by me. The creation of this website and connection to the database took approximately 5 days. However, none of this
would have been possible had I not gotten guidance from my friend Richard Neil. I had bare minimum experience with HTML, and CSS, and
none with PHP. With his guidance I was able to create a functional product. Thank you so much Richard!

Project Name: Banksy

Project Purpose: To create a fictional banking database that would be utilized by the managers at a bank. This database was designed 
specifically so that only managers would be the ones to access this database, thus some attributes that would otherwise be inaccessible
to regular employees, are accessible in the database, such as Social Security Numbers which were randomly generated.

What was involved with the creation of this project:
* Creation of a domain
* Creation of a relational schema
* Creation of a database with randomly generated datasets;
  - Datasets for Members, nonMembers, Bank, and Employee were created and linked together.
* The database was hosted on a remote computer in the school and the use SSH software was required to work on the project.

What was made with the website:
* An Ad-Hoc Query search box, and a CRUD application for the database were added to the website.
* SQL injection mitigation best practices were used in the creation of the Ad-Hoc Query. 
* AdobeXD was used for the CSS and some hand written CSS was also used for parts of the website where the AdobeXD css was broken.

Live snapshots of the website are included in the public_html folder, I will not be updating anymore code as I would like to come back
to this in a few years and cringe a little, it would be nice.
